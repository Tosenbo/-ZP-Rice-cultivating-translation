  <ZP_BRGyudon.label>Gyudon (BR)</ZP_BRGyudon.label>
  <ZP_BRGyudon.description>A somewhat new and rising star in Japanese cuisine, Gyudon-due to its inclusion of beef-is seen as a result of the West's influence during the Meiji Restoration. The dish traditionally entails rice topped with beef and onion, which were simmered in a sauce flavored with dashi, mirin, and soy sauce. The accessibility of Gyudon through yatai in the early 20th century cemented it as a Japanese dish-of-choice.</ZP_BRGyudon.description>
