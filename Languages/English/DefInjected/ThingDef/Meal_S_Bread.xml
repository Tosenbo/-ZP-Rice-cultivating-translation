  <ASU_HotDogBun.description>[Local Product] Almost identical in appearance to the American hot dog bun, Koppepan is more a type of bread, which is often described as lighter and fluffier than most hot dog buns. Moreover, though Koppepan is sometimes used as a hot dog bun, most of the time it is used to make sandwhiches out of various pastes and condiments (egg salad, strawberry jam and butter, Zangi-Japanese deep fried chicken, and many others).\nThe history of Koppepan is begins in the 19th century, when Genpei Tanabe went over to America to master American-style bread. American breadmaking, however, relied on refrigiration in order to manage the yeast necessary for the bread. Japan lacked refrigeration, and thus Genpei developed the Maruzen baking method that utilized dry yeast. Koppepan hit peak exposure during and shortly after the Pacific War; during this time, rationing made it difficult/expensive to consume rice. It was also a staple food on school menus from the 1950's-80's, as it was easier to attain locally, rationed out by the resident forces (Allied occupying force), and is rather nutritious.\nResearch into Koppepan is somewhat difficult, and may require you to search the Japanese language Wikipedia.</ASU_HotDogBun.description>
