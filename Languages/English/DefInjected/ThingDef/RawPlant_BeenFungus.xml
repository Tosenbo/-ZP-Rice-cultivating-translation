  <ZP_RawEdamame.description>Immature soybeans. As these beans have yet to mature properly, their nutritional value-as well as their preservability-is low; however, they can be a convenient meat substitute with how fast they grow.</ZP_RawEdamame.description>

  <WA_Azuki.description>Little red beans that are destined to make something sweet! After being boiled, these beans will be mashed/ground into a fine paste, which can then be applied various confections. The paste is referred to as "Anko" or "Ogura;" moreover, the bean itself has multiple names, with Shōzu-a Chinese loan word-meaning "Small Bean," as opposed to Soybean's Daizu that means "Large Bean."</WA_Azuki.description>
