  <ZP_JunmaiSake.description>Junmai, meaning "Pure rice," is sake made through using only White rice. This sets it apart from others sakes, such as Ginjo, that use non-rice elements. Junmai is also traditionally served warm or at room temperature, while Ginjo is preferably served cold.\nJunmai features a rich, full bodied flavor, and a mildly acidic undertone. ("Body" refers to the complexity and duration of a wine's flavor, with a longer duration being better.)</ZP_JunmaiSake.description>
