  <ZP_Hiyayakko.description>A dish whose choice of toppings allow it to be the perfect drinking snack or a proper side dish. The etymology of Hiyayakko reveals an interesting history; "Hiya" means "cold," but "yakko" refers to the servants samurais had during the Edo period. Due to the frequency with which these servants served the dish to their masters, their name-yakko-was attached to it. Hiyayakko is typically viewed as a Summer dish, since it is served cold; however, in the Winter, it is served in a warm broth.</ZP_Hiyayakko.description>
