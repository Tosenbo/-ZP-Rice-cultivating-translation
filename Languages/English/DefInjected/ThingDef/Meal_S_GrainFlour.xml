  <ZP_Korokke.description>【特産品】Originally introduced to Japan in 1887, Korokke owes its name to the French dish, croquette. The latter takes the form of a small, fried breadcumbed roll, while the former generally comes in the shape of a patty. Though the outside of Korokke is rather simple, the inside is stuffed with chopped seafood, meat, or vegetables, with white sauce or mashed potatoes. The dish is fairly popular in Japan due to its good taste and low cost.</ZP_Korokke.description>
