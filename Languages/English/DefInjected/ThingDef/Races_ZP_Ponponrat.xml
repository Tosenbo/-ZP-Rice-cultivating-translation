  <ZP_Ponponrat.label>Pomb rat</ZP_Ponponrat.label>
  <ZP_Ponponrat.description>A subspecies of boomrat. It seems that these are faster than normal boomrats. Colonists have also reported that-upon butchering-puffed rice can be found in their external organs.\nScientists around the Rim suspect that these, "Pomb rats" are a result of boom rats being fed puffed rice (Muri).\nEither that, or several scientists decided to rewrite some genetics, in an odd attempt to get boom rats to produce something other than explosive liquid. Sadly, Pomb rats actually produce both.\nTheir movement speed and explosive power also seem to have been enhanced. Pomb rats, despite their explosive nature, are not naturally hostile. Breeding among Pomb rat enthusiasts has also led the species to be more intelligent over all.</ZP_Ponponrat.description>
